# Linux Users, Groups, and Permissions

## Objective
Understand how user accounts, groups, and permissions control access to files and system resources in Linux.

## Environment
- Linux (Red Hat–based distribution)
- Terminal / command line

## Commands Practiced
- useradd – create user accounts
- userdel – remove user accounts
- passwd – set or change passwords
- groupadd – create groups
- usermod – modify user group membership
- id – display user identity information
- chmod – change file permissions
- chown – change file ownership
- ls -l – view permissions

## What I Did
- Created and removed user accounts
- Created groups and assigned users to them
- Modified file permissions using symbolic and numeric modes
- Changed file ownership and group ownership
- Verified permissions using `ls -l` and `id`

## Security Relevance
- Enforced least privilege principles
- Controlled access to sensitive files
- Practiced access management similar to enterprise environments

## Outcome
Gained hands-on experience managing users, groups, and permissions in Linux systems.
